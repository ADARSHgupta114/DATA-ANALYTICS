###  Conclusion
>I think this is a very interesting dataset. In my opinion it shows that hydroelectric and nuclear electricity production are the most reliable, but they still suffer from weather (in the case of hydroelectric) and mentanance in the case of nuclear.
Wind is not predictible at all, but when it blows it can generate big electricity outputs.
Gas and oil are still a big part of electricity production and they where affeted by the onset of the Ukraine war.
